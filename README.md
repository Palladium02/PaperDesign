# PaperDesign
A CSS framework with a few JS components.

This CSS framework contains some JS components which will look good but not work properly
if you do not embed the "pd.js"-file.

## Components

### Table
```html
    <table class="pd-table">
     <thead>
      <tr>
       <th>#</th>
       <th>Name</th>
       <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <td>1</td>
       <td>Caviar</td>
       <td>50$</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>2</td>
       <td>Rib-Eye</td>
       <td>20$</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>
```
